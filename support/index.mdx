## Got Questions?
If you have questions, find something missing, or have suggestions on how to improve the
workbook, please [file an issue](https://github.com/faithtechcreate/workbook) for us.

## Get Involved
This is an open source project so there are many ways that you can get involved. Here are some ideas for you:

- Go through the workbook and let us know if something is missing by [filing an issue](https://github.com/faithtechcreate/workbook) or chatting with our community on Slack.
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/FaithTechCreate/workbook/issues). Provide workarounds and suggestions that can resolve them.
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request. Issues tagged as [good first issue](https://github.com/FaithTechCreate/workbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are a good place to get started.
- Read through the workbook. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can click "Edit this page" at the bottom of most docs, which takes you to the GitHub interface to make and propose changes.
- Take a look at the features requested by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

We welcome ideas and contributions that improve the workbook. Check out the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/faithtechcreate/workbook)
